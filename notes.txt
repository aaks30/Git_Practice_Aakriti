Git is a version control tool to ensure the changes done to a code are properly vetted and incase of any issue could be reverted to the previous state. Github is a part of Git where collaborators make changes in the branches and push it on the main branch 
Git branches allow devs to work on multiple objects without disturbing the main code.
